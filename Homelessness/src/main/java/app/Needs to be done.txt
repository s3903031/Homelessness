1. Need to hear back from Tim
2. Test that state table maker works. Find out why it doesn't show results for 'other' states.
Enable a user to see how other factors might impact homelessness in each LGA. For 
each LGA a user should be able to find the:
    i. Ratio of homeless people to the total number of people (Column)
    ii. Ratio of homeless people by age and gender to the total number of people (Filters)
    iii. Median age, median mortgage repayments, weekly rent and weekly income for 
households in the LGA (Columns)
• Enable the user to filter the above information by region, gender and numeric ranges. 
For example, find the homeless ratio for women in Victorian LGAs with an average (Filters)
weekly income under $500 and a median age of over 50.
• Enable a user to answer questions such as:
    i. What is the homeless rate in the LGA with the highest/lowest weekly income? (Sorting)
    ii. What is the homeless rate in the LGA with the highest/lowest median age? (Sorting)
    iii. What is the homeless rate in the LGA with the highest/lowest rent? (Sorting)
    iv. What is the LGA with the highest/lowest ratio of homeless gender? (Sorting (Also make column))
• Enable a user to see if there are any trends of the number of homeless people based on 
the average weekly income in each LGA. For example, showing how the homeless ratio
(as calculated above) changes as the weekly income increases or decreases (Sorting)
A total / average row at the top
Columns needed:
1. Ratio of homeless poeple to the total number of people (homeless people per 10000 population)
2. Median age
3. Median mortgage repayments
4. Weekly rent
5. Weekly income
6. Homeless gener ratio (Homeless males / Homeless females) *Only make this column if they have selected both males and females
Filters needed:
1. Age
2. State
3. gender
4. LGA attributes (Min and Max for each)
Sorting:
1. Weekly income
2. Median age
3. Median rent
4. Homeless gender ratio


2. Compare the change in homelessness over time. You should:
• Enable a user to study how the rate of homelessness has changed between 2016 and 
2018 in all LGAs compared to changes in the population. For each LGA a user should be 
able to find the:
    i. Total (or percentage) change in the number of homeless people (Column)
    ii. Total (or percentage) change in the number of ‘at risk’ people (Column)
    iii. Total (or percentage) change in the total population (Column)
    iv. Ratio of the change in the number of homeless people to the change in the 
number of people at risk of being homeless (Column)
• Enable the user to filter the information by region, gender and age group. For example, 
find the ratio in the changes of homeless women in Victorian LGAs where the total 
population of the LGA has increased. (Filters)
• Enable a user to answer questions such as:
    i. What is the change in homelessness in the LGA with the largest change in total 
    population? (Sorting)
    ii. Which LGA has seen the largest increase of homeless women? (Filters)
    iii. Which LGA has seen the largest decrease of homeless children? (Filters)
    iv. Which LGA has seen the largest shift of people from being ‘at risk’ to actually 
    being homeless? (Can we assume that anyone who was homeless in 2016 was at risk of being homeleses in 2016)
• Enable a user to see if there are any trends of the number of homeless people based on 
how the percentage change in homeless people (as calculated above) changes as the 
total population of a LGA changes (Sorting)
